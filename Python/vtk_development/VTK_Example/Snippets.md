### Description
Snippets are chunks of code that can be cut (*snipped*) and pasted into examples. We want each example to be stand-alone, so we do not keep the snippet code in a library.

### Available snippets

#### [GetProgramParameters](/Python/Snippets/GetProgramParameters.md)
Get the program parameters.

#### [ReadPolyData](/Python/Snippets/ReadPolyData.md)
Uses the appropriate vtkPolyData reader to read any vtkPolyData file.

#### [WriteImage](/Python/Snippets/WriteImage.md)
Take a screen shot from the render window and write it to a file. The file extension selects the writer to use.
