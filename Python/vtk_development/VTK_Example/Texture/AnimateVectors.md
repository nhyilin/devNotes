### Description
Texture maps can be animated as a function of time. By choosing a texture map whose intensity varies monotonically from dark to light, and then “moving” the texture along an object,the object appears to crawl in the direction of the texture map motion. We can use this technique to add apparent motion to things like hedgehogs to show vector magnitude. This example uses texture map animation to simulate vector field motion.
