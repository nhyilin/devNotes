### Description
The polygon is a primary two-dimensional cell. The polygon is defined by an ordered list of three or more points lying in a plane. The polygon normal is implicitly defined by a counterclockwise ordering of its points using the right-hand rule.

The polygon may be nonconvex, but may not have internal loops, and it cannot self-intersect. The polygon has n edges, where n is the number of points in the polygon.
