### Description
The example creates an elliptical cross-section and stores it in a vtkPolyData. Then, the vtkLinearExtrusionFilter creates an elliptical cylinder by extruding the vtkPolyLine along a vector.  The example sets the backface property of the vtkActor to show the front and back face of the cylinder.
