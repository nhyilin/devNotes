### Description

This example will help you understand the [Marching Cubes Algorithm](http://marchingcubes.org/images/f/f9/MarchingCubes.pdf). The example takes one optional argument, a case number. There are 15 Marching Cubes cases, 0-14. There are also 15 complementary cases where the inside/outside value is flipped. To see a complementary case, supply a negative case number. For example, -7 is the complementary case of 7.

!!! note
    According to the [ACM Digital Library](http://dl.acm.org/sig.cfm?id=SP932), the Marching Cubes paper is the most cited Siggraph paper.
