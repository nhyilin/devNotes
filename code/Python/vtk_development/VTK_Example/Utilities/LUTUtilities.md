### Description

A class called LUTUtilities is demonstrated along with a test harness that shows you how to use the class.

This class allows you to:

* Print the contents of the lookup table

* Compare two lookup tables to see if they are the same.

The test harness is a function called: TestLookupTables that tests pairs of lookup tables against each other.

The program will not display any output if all tests are successful.
