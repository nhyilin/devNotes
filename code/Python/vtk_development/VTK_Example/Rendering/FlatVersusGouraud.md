### Description
Flat and Gouraud shading. Different shading methods can dramatically improve the look of an object represented with polygons. On the top, flat shading uses a constant surface normal across each polygon. On the bottom, Gouraud shading interpolates normals from polygon vertices to give a smoother look.

In this example, the flat and gouraud images for each pair have linked cameras. Rotate and zoom a pair to get a better look at the differences.
