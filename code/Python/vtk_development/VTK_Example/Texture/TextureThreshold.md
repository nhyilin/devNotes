### Description
Demonstrating texture thresholding applied to scalar data from a simulation of fluid flow.

There are three planes cutting the blunt fin with different thresholds set. From the left, the scalar threshold is set so that:

   1) Only data with a scalar value greater than or equal to 1.5 is shown.
   2) Only data with a scalar value less than or equal to 1.5 is shown.
   3) Only data with a scalar value between 1.5 and 1.8 inclusive is shown.
