### Description
Clip geometry using a 2D texture map and two implicit functions. The
technique is described in : [Geometric Clipping Using Boolean
Textures](http://marchingcubes.org/images/c/c0/GeometricClippingUsingBooleanTextures.pdf).

!!! note
    This example is a modification of example shown in Figure 9-45 in the [VTK Text Book](https://www.kitware.com/products/books/VTKTextbook.pdf).
