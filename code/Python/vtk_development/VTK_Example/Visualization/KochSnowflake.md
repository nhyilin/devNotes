### Description

This script draws a Koch snowflake using the VTK. The general idea is to exercise some of the components of a vtkPolyData to produce something interesting rather than a boring old cube. Not that I have anything against cubes. There is also a C++ version of this example: [KochSnowflake](/Cxx/Visualization/KochSnowflake).
