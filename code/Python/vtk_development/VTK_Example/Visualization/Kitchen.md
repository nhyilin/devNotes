### Description
The example shows forty streamlines in a small kitchen. The room has two windows, a door(with air leakage), and a cooking area with a hot stove. The air leakage and temperature variation combine to produce air convection currents throughout the kitchen. The starting positions of the streamlines were defined by creating a rake, or curve (and its associated points). Here the rake was a straight line modeled with a vtkLineSource. These streamlines clearly show features of the flow field. By releasing many streamlines simultaneously we obtain even more information, as the eye tends to assemble nearby streamlines into a “global” understanding of flow field features.
